# Demo and Usage
* Download code, open index.htm file to view demo. Voila!
* Type something in the search box, press Search. The playlist will appear. Select your item you want to preview.
* I comment my code and make every line as much easy as possible. I believe you can easily use/customize my plugin without any problem.

# Credit
* Months ago, I took a look at this plugin [https://github.com/dan0/youtubeplaylist]. It's nice, but different style of code from me. There are some similar pieces of code, *but my plugin is my own code, honestly*.
* I use a regex from http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/05/jYouTube-jquery-YouTube-thumbnail.html
